# Edit Next File

**Navigate the editor seamlessly through your workspace files.** Sometimes you just want to open the next (or previous) file on the system. This extension makes it effortless.

## Key Features

- **Navigate through your workspace**: Jump to the next or previous file in the workspace, whether it's open or not.
- **Simple commands**: Contributes two commands:
  - _Navigate to Next File_: Opens the next file in the workspace.
  - _Navigate to Previous File_: Opens the previous file in the workspace.

## How Navigation Works

- **Traverse folder levels**: Navigation moves through files in each folder and subfolder, level by level.
- **Wraps around the workspace**: If you reach the top or bottom of the folder tree, navigation loops back to the other end, allowing for continuous file traversal.

## Keybinding Suggestions

For ease of use, bind the navigation commands to keyboard shortcuts. For example:

- **Next file**: `Ctrl+Alt+Down`
- **Previous file**: `Ctrl+Alt+Up`

## Requirements

- **None**
